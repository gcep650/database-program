Includes a demonstration of the project. Review specific guidelines for each event as guidelines vary.

Topic: Develop an original computer program to track hours for the Community Service Awards program for your chapter members. The program must complete a minimum of the following tasks:

    Track student name, student number, and grade in school with ability to enter/view/edit.
    Track the total of community service hours per student with ability to enter/view/edit.
    Track the Community Service Award program category per student with the ability to enter/view/edit.
    Generate or print weekly/monthly report to show total number of community service hours per student.
    Generate or print weekly/monthly report to show Community Service Award program categories and total hours.
    Data must be stored persistently. Storage may be in a relational database, a document-oriented NoSQL database, flat text files, flat JSON, or XML files.
    The user interface must be a GUI with a minimum of five different control types including such things as drop-down lists, text fields, check boxes, emails, or other relevant control types.
    All data entry must be validated with appropriate user notifications and error messages including the use of required fields.

Skills: Certain types of processes require that each record in the file be processed. Coding & Programming focuses on these procedural style processing systems. This event tests the programmer’s skill in designing a useful, efficient, and effective program.
